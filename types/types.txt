what happens in paintarticle?

Well first I grab all the params whose key starts with '--' and create a new object 'cssvars'

I use motif+shells to get the polygon data from cachelattice.js

I get an array of true and false values from the bitmask param by converting it to binary, splitting the ones and zeros, and mapping over with Number/Boolean to get trues and falses

cachelettice.shells is an array of arrays
If I apply the bitmask to the top level array, I get shell-by-shell maskedgeometry, or if I flatten it first I can apply the bitmask on a polygon-by-polygon basis

Here's a surprising thing:
JS can coerce an empty array to the number 0
JS can coerce a single element array to a number
Coercing any longer array to number results in NaN

turf.polygon takes an array of [x,y] tuples and returns a polygoncollection
















Types:
	how about cssvars are always keys with -- and strings as values, all these vars are on the defaultparams so should have a whole param type

	boolmask :: Boolean[]

	flatgeometry :: Polygon[]
	maskgeometry :: Polygon[] (?: returns flat)

	allpolygons  :: polygoncollection 	
	maskpolygons :: polygoncollection

	{features: [
		{geometry: [
			{coordinates: [[x,y]]}
		]}
	]}

	articlebbox/sectionbbox -> (-90/90)[4]
	viewbox -> csspixel[4]
